* Group, category and tone pickers are not set in accordance with the INTEGRA-7 at startup.
	* Done, but it seems like it does a lot of unneccesary work. Take a look at it!

* Changing tone from a drum kit to another type does not erase text on keyboard.

* Drum keys names are one key too low.

Some drum names are wrong.

* When a drum kit is selected on I7 before startup, app fails to fill in key names.

* Changin tone does not set current tone for the editor. Editor always get the tone that was set in I7 at app start?!?

Category is set wrong in Edit. Fixed by changing it after wrong value has been found by this:
    cbEditTone_InstrumentCategorySelector.SelectedIndex = toneCategories.snsToneCategoryNameIndex[superNATURALSynthTone.superNATURALSynthToneCommon.Category];
	Check this list!

Some edit controls are too high.

There is no black space between controls. Compare with I7 random app to see how to fix it.

Edit SN-D crashes in UpdateSuperNaturalDrumKitKeySelector().

Fix the store images.

Implement a close function in all device-dependent project, empty for tablets but closes apps for desktops.
	Use when vender driver is detected.

Edit hangs when sending a change via 5-pin MIDI.

If studio set editor button is hit with no tone selected, it chrashes!

Do not show librarian window unless MIDI is ok.

Continue on the Studio set editor.
	There are a lot of control labels that has no initial value.
	Column 1:
		* Tempo is not integer, is there a reason for that?
		* When selecting a studio set, selector is left blank, and when opening it, it is scrolled down halfways.
		* External part level reacts on arrow keys after 4 key presses. Is it not an integer?
		* Ext part chorus/reverb levels are not integers. When changing, they update tempo label, not their own labels!
	Column 2:
		System common settings:
			* Master key shift is not integer, is there a reason for that?
			Cannot test 'Use scale tune switch' since I cannot find it in the manual, but it sends to I-7 so it is probably ok.
			* There is a system tempo here, reason for that? Yes, this is the system tempo. The one in first column is the 
				* studio set tempo. And here below is a selector to let system control tempo, or studio set.
				* But it has no values in its label...
		Voice reserv:
		Chorus:
			Chorus-chorus:
				* Output select does not work.
				* Filter cutoff frequency is not properly set, but it works to change. Seems to be a bug in I-7. It reports wrong,
					* but if changed on the front panel, and from program change to delay and back agin, I-7 reports correct value.
				Rate/Hz controls (selectable with 'Rate (num/notesw)') occupies each one row, they should occupy the same row.
				* Hz low limits should be 0.05 to 10.
				* Hz in not properly initialized and still has the slider int problem.
				* Note in not properly initialized.
				* All sliders uses many arrow keypress to change one step. Not an integer?
				* Feedback is not properly initiated.
				* When selecting chorus-chorus, then selecting another page (reverb, motional surround etc.) and back again,
					* chorus page is set correctly to chorus-chorus, but shows only off parameters, not chorus-chorus parameters.
			Chorus-delay:
				* Output select does not work.
				* When selecting this from chorus-shorus, screen is not properly cleared.
				Num/note same problem as in chorus-chorus.
				* Num/note switches does not send to I-7.
				* Sliders int problem.
				* Center feedback is not initialized.
				* HF Damp lacks 'BYPASS' entry and possibly not initialized (maybe due to the missing entry).
		Reverb:
			* There are two time sliders in the same row and other GUI errors when first selected, but gets
				* right when selecting a type.
			* Does not react to type off.
			* Level is not initiated, and label has no space between text and value.
			* Most sliders (all but Spread) has the int problem.
				* GM2 reverb Time label shows no decimals.
		Motional surround:
			* Motional switch surround is missing.
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		MasterEQ:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
	Column 3:
		Maybe swap settings page selector with part selector.
		* Part is always set to part 2 after initialization, why?
		* Page selector is not set.
		Part settings page 1:
			* Change channel warning dialog lacks some text. Probably wrong thype of dialog (there are two types).
			* Selecting tone via search box does not update I-7.
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		Part settings page 2:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		Keyboard parameters:
			* Velocity range upper/lower should have 1 as minimum, not 0.
			* All sliders has the int problem.
		Scale tune parameters:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
			* Key sliders has wrong upper/lower limits. Should be -64 -- +63.
		Midi:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
			* Velocity curve type (adr 0x43) missing? Why is there a 'Phase lock' switch?
		Motional surround:
			L/R and F/B lacks offsets. Should be in range -64 -- +63.
			Ambience send level is not initialized.
		Studio set part EQ:
			* All sliders has the int problem.
			* Switch is missing.

Test these now that they exist:
There is no return button in studio set editor!
Save/SaveFile/LoadFile buttons missing
Save slot selector is missing
Save slot name input field s missing

Continue on the Favorites.

* Add Surround page. Invent new way of 'dragging' controls since image has no coordinates in events.

Add saving/loading settings in xml files (for all platforms!)
	Most done for UWP, except motional surround (if we need it).

Why is not cbStudioSetPartKeyboardMute added to the GUI?

* Studio set part selector returns to part 1 when other is selected!

When selecting studio set editor after startup, and then return to librarian, 
	motional surround is not fully read in. It is read in only when:
	1) Motional surround is selected before studio set editor after startup.
	2) Studio set editor is selected after startup and part subpage motional
		surround is selected. If so, motional surround will place labels
		correctly, if not they will all be centered due to this issue.

Maybe add a switch for turning motional surround on/off?

Debug session is not closed after closing main window!

Verification tool reports crashes! (Maybe that has same cause as issue above?)
