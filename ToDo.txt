* Add initial read of user tones.
	This was already implemented by adding a button that reads user tones first time it is cliked, and then is a seletor
	for user tones, preset tones and both user tones and preset tones.

Initial tone seletion is not done properly. One must re-select category and tone before correct tone can be edited.

Some edit pages have too high controls. Probably missing empty rows. Check main rowdefinitions for the dynamic controls area.

Add CheckForVenderDriver and invoke for Windows version.

Check how settings can be handled in the different platforms, or if already implemented in Xamarin.

Check for how to implement file I/O in the different platforms.
